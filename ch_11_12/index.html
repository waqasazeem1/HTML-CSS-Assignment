        <h2>Cloud Native computing</h2>
        <p>The <b>Cloud Native Computing</b> program prepares the students to program in open source technology like,
            <b><i>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, Javascript, Node js, React and React NAtive</i></b>while introducing the
            student to
            development of Microservices aand soft development techniques on cloud platform like AWS.

        <h2>Artificail Intelligence:</h2>
        <p>The artifical Intelligence program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI technology,
            via
            teachnology, via teaching programing in open source languages like <b><i>python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow
                    2.0
                    and flask,</i></b>
            and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with real-life example of modern day
            AI
            in practice.

    </div>
    <div class="IOT">

        <h2>Blockchain:</h2>
        <p>The main emphasis of <b>Blockchain</b> program is to understand the blockchains like <b>Ethereum and
                Hyperledger
                (Fabric)</b>,
            and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, Javascript on frameworks like Node.js. The program also
            introduces them to development of Distributed
            Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-services (BaaS)
            and
            how to develop and offer an Intial Coin
            Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.

    <div class="BC">
        <h2>Internet of Things:</h2>
        <p>The <b>Internet of things</b> programing introduces the students to open source development technology like
            <b><i> Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes </i> </b>while
            making
            them efficient in developing
            Micro services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice computing for devices control.
